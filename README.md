# ToE Core

This is a reference implementation of the ToE (time-oriented events) data model in Ruby. ToE was designed to model multiple heterogeneous event streams resulting from linguistic and psychological experiments.

## Installation

toe_core is bundled as a gem.

    gem toe_core

## Requirements

Currently, the following gems are required for toe_core to work:

- libxml-ruby
- nokogiri
- haml
- rdf

We are in the process of switching to nokogiri completely in one of the next minor releases. Until then, both XML libraries will be necessary.
